# Problem definition : Optimization of Multimodal Transportation Systems

## Objective

Develop and improve computational methods to optimize the design, scheduling, and operational efficiency of multimodal transportation networks in rural areas. 
The solution should address network design enhancements, adherence to scheduling and capacity constraints, and optimization of multiple evaluation 
criteria including cost, time, CO2 emissions, passenger comfort, traffic jams etc. Our research focuses mainly on rural areas.

## Key Challenges:

    ### Network Design:
        Inadequate infrastructure: Rural areas often have limited transportation infrastructure, requiring innovative network designs that can integrate multiple modes of transport seamlessly.
        Integration of new technologies: Incorporating emerging technologies such as real-time data tracking and advanced communication systems (like 5G) to enhance connectivity and efficiency.

    ### Scheduling and Sizing Constraints:
        Service frequency and timing: Designing schedules that effectively balance limited resources with the need for regular service intervals to meet the demands of rural populations.
        Capacity management: Determining the optimal size and number of vehicles or transport units needed per route to maximize efficiency and meet fluctuating demand.

    ### Optimization Criteria:
        Economic factors: Minimizing costs associated with operations, maintenance, and infrastructure development.
        Environmental impact: Reducing CO2 emissions through efficient route planning and adoption of greener technologies.
        Social factors: Enhancing passenger comfort and convenience, crucial for encouraging the use of public transport systems.
        Operational efficiency: Improving travel time, reliability, and overall service quality.
