# Phase 1: Understanding the project

### The project is made up of 3 or 4 sub-problems

1. Modelize the **design network** : Develop a computational model that simulates the network design for multimodal transportation systems in rural areas, integrating various transport modes and technologies. This modelling must be modifiable.
2. Modelize the **scheduling constraints** : Modelize the scheduling constraints vehicle in the simulation.
3. Create a **model** implementing **design network** and **scheduling constraints** : Creating a comprehensive model that integrates both network design and scheduling constraints.
4. (Optional if we choose a **ML** approach): Create or find a **dataset** and **train** the **model**.
